# scifi-database

This is an Obsidian workspace I'm putting together. To interact with it best, just clone this repo, and open the 'content' folder as an Obsidian Vault. 

YAML section should have three things: 
- author
    - This always refers to the person credited as "author", or "written by" of a comic, novel, or story. 
    - For movies or shows, this can be the director OR the writer, whichever name is best associative for the work. 
- rate: 0-10
- date: date last read, can be estimated. 

Types of pages: 
- Short stories
- Episodes, or series or anthologies
- Movies
- Novels 
- People, for the most prolific authors or notable designers

Tags can be several things: 
- genres, such as #romance or #slasher
- themes, such as #lovecraftian or #bizarre
- plot devices, such as #space-elevator or #control problem
- specific recurrences, like #von-neumann-like or #abandoned-earth
