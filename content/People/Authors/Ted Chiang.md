- Chiang is consistently the most impressive Author I read - I just can't think of a weakness of his. His stories can be technical and inventive, but always grounded in human emotion and character - something most authors have to pick between, he just does both. 
- Every story he's written is extremely memorable for being at once unique, scientifically inventive, and emotional. 
- My only complaint is that he doesn't write enough, but it's understandable given the quality of what he produces.
