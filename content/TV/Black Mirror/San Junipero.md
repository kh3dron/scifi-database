Probably the best BM episode ever made! Romantic and sweet. 
Watched most recently at home over thanksgiving break in 2022, same night I watched Minority report. Was up late building a lego set. 

I had this video on my mind after reading [[The Silicon Man]]. Really lovely - romantic and sweet, very personal, simple yet high-concept. Thereâ€™s so much room in this idea to go further, which other black mirror episodes do to some extent - but there could always be more.
