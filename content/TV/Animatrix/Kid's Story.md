- One of the stranger works from this collection. Unclear what the role of this character was meant to be before this short was made - maybe was never meant to be expanded on from the movies.
- Weird, uncomfortable mixed messaging here to be mixing suicide into the matrix environment so directly. 
- Always loved the "you are not alone." shot at the end, though.
