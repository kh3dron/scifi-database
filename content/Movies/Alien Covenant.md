[[H.R. Giger]]

- Watched in Fall of 2021, finding this by complete surprise! 
- Gets major credit for being the kind of movie I wish there were more of - extremely high concept scifi. slightly gory for my taste, but win some lose some
- #body-horror and #slasher as is customary for Alien stuff, same as #biology 
- I like that this one departs a little from the structure of the earlier works - really sets up room for more sequels in an interesting way, bummer it looks unlikely
- Fassbender is always amazing
- the #twist is a little telegraphed but very upsetting, iykyk
