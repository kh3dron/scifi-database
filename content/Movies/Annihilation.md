- Really rare kind of movie! Watched in Spring of 2018 in my copeland single. Had one man movie nights for a while, also chose MIB and Source Code for some reason
- Completely missed a theater run for some reason
- Similar structure as [[Predator]] - I guess this one should get the #slasher tag as well, but it doesn't feel like that
- Extremely disturbing all around - probably the most so of this list 
- Excellent use of the #lovecraftian and #cosmic-horror genres - again, just really unique
- Lots of similarities in plot and structure to [[Extraction Request]]
