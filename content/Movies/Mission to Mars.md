- Favorite part of this movie has to be the score - Ennio Morricone best work. The first time I watched this as an adult I knew it was him without even checking
- The other memory I have from this movie is Mr. Wilcolm, my 5th grade math teacher, telling us about the Dr. Pepper trick from this movie. I'd forgotten about him until I watched that scene. Overall a wonderful experience watching this
