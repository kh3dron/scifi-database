- Favorite part of this movie has to be the score - Ennio Morricone best work. The first time I watched this as an adult I knew it was him without even checking
- The other memory I have from this movie is Mr. Wilcolm, my 5th grade math teacher, telling us about the Dr. Pepper trick from this movie. I'd forgotten about him until I watched that scene. Overall a wonderful experience watching this 

so full of heart. some excellent writing tying together the drama of the setting and human moments - dance the night away, dr. pepper leak and helmet removal scenes are amazingly made. hard to think of other examples of movies clicking in all dimensions like that. All the characters feel very fleshed out, and the actors have wonderful chemistry together that drives home the very personal focus of the story. 

the closest point of comparison is Interstellar, and while that one looks better, I like the writing of this movie more - they have similar messages, but there's more subtlety here, more showing instead of telling. granted the story is a little simpler so there's less explanation needed, but that's a feature too. 

CGI comes off sort of dated, but in a charming way that ages well. Especially the sound design of the 2000's robot voice also brings a really unique atmosphere to the whole thing. The intonation of "critical system alert" is forever locked into my mind.

Ennio Morricone's score here puts this movie on a whole different level. does wonders for managing the energy and pacing in the big scenes. truly the best of the best, so good I only listen to this score on rare special occasions. the moments hearing the echoes of the spaghetti western themes against the tracking shots of the martian landscape is so indescribably amazing

I rank this the top space movie of all time. which is a serious title
