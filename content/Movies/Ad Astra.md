#space #parents #action 

- Very empty feeling, like [[Interstellar]]
- Watched this with dad in the Hopkins house, maybe Thanksgiving 2019? 
- Some good acting but very weak story. Poorly put together, bouncing between action sequences too fast. 
- Weird for a space movie but tagging with #minor-sf-elements , as I think the little story that's here could be told just as well without all the space stuff
	- Crazy that it also has a #space-elevator
