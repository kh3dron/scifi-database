#time/time-travel #environmental 

- Really great performances from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt
- Probably the most predictable #twist of any movie I've ever seen but still nice to be a part of it
- Likes the touches of a) time travel making people go insane, and b) time machines not working that well. Two things that seem like they should be brought up more in time travel fiction but aren't
