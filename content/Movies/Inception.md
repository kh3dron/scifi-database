[[Christopher Nolan]]

- Watched with Steph in Iceland, Jan 2024

First watched this in theaters with my dad. Thought it was a unique plot device to set up a heist movie. But now, 12 years later, the heist is almost the least interesting part. (Almost)

Far more compelling are the scenes about what a physical, surreal manifestation of grief could look like; building a house to store painful memories in, pushing a button to go to the basement and see someone’s deepest regret. Being so constantly haunted that a train from your past passes you on the street, where it has no business being, just because it’s always your mind wherever you go.

But from that setup, the conclusion is a novel interpretation of “moving on”- you have to let your memories go first and foremost out of disappointment, because you just can’t do a good enough job of holding on to them. Maybe if they were stronger you could stay, but they’re not. Not the typical lesson there. 

I think this is one of the best marriages between plot device and a human story in science fiction - same tier as Arrival, Interstellar, or The Matrix. It doesn’t get enough credit for that, only because it also looks so fucking cool at the same time, so you can ignore all that and get a 10/10 experience from watching Paris bend upside down or the amazing fight choreography. 

Maybe this was all obvious to everyone else the first time around, but as Robert Fischer says, “I WAS 11.”
