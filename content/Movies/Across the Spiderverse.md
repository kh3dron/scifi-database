#multiverse 

- obvious high point here is the art style
- Was seriously thrown off by sudden [[Syd Mead]] references in the 2099 city - need some new tags here, like #cities and #megastructures/space-elevator
	- Felt like there was an homage to [[The Machine Stops]] as well, in the underground tunnels that keep the world running. Also similar to [[The Time Machine (H.G. Wells)]]. Wonderful to see these things animated so nicely, hard scifi like this is usually reserved for writing as it's too ambitious to depict well
