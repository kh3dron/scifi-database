- Another collaboration between [[Christopher Nolan]] and [[Hanz Zimmer]], excellent as always
- Lots of homages to [[2001 A Space Odyssey (Movie)]], as expected. some more obvious than others - TARS is modeled after the monoliths of course, but also noticeable in the scores during the first few floating-in-space scenes. Debatable if 2001 gets credit for all of those, since it's a trope used often, but I think it gets credit 
	- Love TARS's design and character, great #robots 
- #megastructures/oneill-cylinder referenced at the end. I happened to watch this in theaters right after finishing [[Rendezvous with Rama]], so it was cool to see O'Neil cylinders depicted in film like that. 
- Love the #dimensionality of the library scene at the end - gets flack as being too weird by many but I'm in to it 
- Probably the most ambitious and grounded space traveling movies ever made, can't think of another that takes itself as seriously and does so well 
- #parents 
- Adding a light #abandoned-earth tag here, not strongly but worth pointing out since it's an important part of the plot
