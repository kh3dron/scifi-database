#AGI #minds/hive-minds 

- Rare speculation on AGI / ASI, which is nice
- This movie is so frustrating in that it's afraid of its own conclusion. It has a luddite cult defeat this ASI for no good reason other than it's a cleaner ending. I wish they'd instead left things more ambiguous and optimistic instead of taking such a hard, unneeded reversion to the status quo.
