- One of the first movies I watched in College, Friday night in Copeland!
- Roshan's favorite series
- Excellent slasher/SF combinations, same overlap as [[The Terminator]] and to a much lesser extent [[Event Horizon]]
- I think [[Avatar]] gives some homage to this by casting Sigourney Weaver
	- Among other ways, obviously
- #biology gets a mention for some thought put into this series 
- Some great comics from this series, which I want to get to at some point

Canonically related:
