- Lots of art done by [[Syd Mead]]
- really love the look of this! Obviously it's all computery, but the graphics feel really deliberately stylized. The world here looks just like what we made in Jeff's Graphics class, with old school matrix wireframes and flat light models. Feels really authentic, which isn't captured in the reboot with the same way. 
- Sequel is [[Tron Legacy]]
