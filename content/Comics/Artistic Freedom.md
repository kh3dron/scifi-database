#matrix #lovecraftian 
- An artist creates sculptures that induce nightmares in her patrons.
- It’s a little unclear to me what the reveal is supposed to be, but that’s one line of dialogue. Nice to see spoon kid. Nice artwork, and I like these stories that focus a little more on life for people still inside the matrix.
