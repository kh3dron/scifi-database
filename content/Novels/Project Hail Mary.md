- Initial setup is very similar to [[We Are Legion]], in terms of main character remembering / discovering his predicament in space
- Parts of it felt similar to [[Permutation City]], funny enough - trying to control an alien parasite eating the sun / reality
- Language focus in SF similar to [[Arrival]]
- Obviously similar to [[The Martian]]
