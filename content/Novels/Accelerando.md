#fix-up
- Technically an anthology, but has since been published in a single book, and that's how I read it
- Gets credit for being intensely speculative and futuristic, while attempting to stay realistic. Probably the furthest I've encountered someone trying to intelligently speculate and with the most aggressive vision, which is the credit many give this book. 
- Leans hard into #brain-apis and #children/post-humans angle in the later sections, same with #computronium and #vr 
- Also hits #simulated-minds , #uploaded-minds 
- really shocking to see #aliens/superior-aliens and #aliens/inferior-aliens in the same story. Multiple civilizations interacting together, like [[Death's End]]
- really like the ideas of corporations, simulated minds, and sentient programs meshing into single beings moving through a meta-space of law/mind/money, absolutely fascinating. And written in a way that makes total sense!
