- By kazuo ishiguro, same as [[Never Let Me Go]]
	- Bizarrely similar. Enormous elements of plot and theme are lifted from Never Let Me Go here, to the extent it didn't feel like reading a new book. Never felt that way before and makes me not very interested to read more by Ishiguro, I'd rather just re-read my favorite.
