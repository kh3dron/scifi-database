Read Fall ‘15, when it came out. Read it because I liked [[Ready Player One]] in middle school. I finished it in a jimmy johns, eating a tuna sandwich before black belt class started. This was the first semester I drove myself in to school and could go right to Jake’s after.

Basically the same premise as RP1, mixed in with [[Ender's Game]]
