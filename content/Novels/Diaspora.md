#von-neumann-like #technical #dimensionality #flesh #self-manipulation 

- Very similar to [[We Are Legion (Bobiverse 1)]] in terms of being post-flesh, post-survival - also about life as #simulated-minds
- Subplot of #uplifting other species from disaster, very much the same as in [[We Are Legion (Bobiverse 1)]]
- It takes serious chops to put as much depth and thought into inventing new #physics as is done in this book, very impressive by Eagan
