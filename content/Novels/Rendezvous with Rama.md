Fall break of 2014. I remember starting this story at the chairs outside the choir room on the Friday afternoon before fall break. It was snowing lightly, and it just started to get cold out. I’d stayed late on campus until 4 or so finishing up a calc test, and I just took a few minutes to start the book. I was in awe at that opening framing it has. We saw [[Interstellar]] in theaters that break and It loved seeing the O’neil cylinder on the big screen.

- Written by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]
- A sort of #computronium referenced here, in the seas that can congeal or dissolve into robotic flesh. Reminds me of [[Solaris]] a bit, although quite different in meaning to the story
