Feb â€˜22, read this on my ipad mini that I brought back from home. Really gritty, which is unusual for sci-fi. Did not care to read the sequel, but some really interesting metaversey-stuff in here, like the gig economy assassination sequence


- Great use of #vr
- Lots of #action - 
- Favorite sequence was a distribued assassination - hundreds of people had small parts of building a gun together and handing the pieces off, very cool, extremely memorable 
- Good mix of action and technology, on par with [[Nexus]]
- Also reminiscent of [[Snow Crash]]
