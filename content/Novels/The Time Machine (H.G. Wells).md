- One of the first science fiction stories I ever read, maybe the first! 
- Extremely memorable. Something about the way the story is written, each section has a very distinct mood but still feels cohesive. The first setting of the dinner party story, to exploring the world of the eloi, the action, and then the melancholy ending sequences traveling further into the distant future when everything has changed so far beyond recognition. Fantastic
