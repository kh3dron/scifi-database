Sequel: [[Crux]]

#religion

Summer â€˜18, working at Mathnasium after my first year of college. Read this while looping through the Only God Forgives score. Incredible series - rare to get such action AND sci-fi in one shot.

- Best #action series I've ever read, especially the first book. One of the few I've re-read: first in sumer '18, the next over christmas break '20 I think. Tore through it both times. 
- The definitive story writen on #brain-apis . Excellent at exploring the possibilities of apps built on top of this layer.
