- Clearly written by Marvin Minsky - references his society of mind concept constantly. Became a little obnoxious at some point, like half the story was the protagonist discovering that all of the author's theories were true. Fair to write it that way but felt distracting - maybe wouldn't have felt this way if I hadn't read the textbook first
- Very similar to [[Nexus]] or [[The Silicon Man]] in feel and structure, but fell flat of both. Action wasn't written very well, and there were an enormous amount of Checkov's guns left lying around, like the passport issues in the third act. 
- Gets a partial #past-future tag here, as it's set in 2022-2024
