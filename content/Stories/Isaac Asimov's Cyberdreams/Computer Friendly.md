#children #vr 

- Has a "meet the creator" sort of ending, reminiscent of [[Snowpiercer]] or The Wizard of Oz
- Also similar in plot to [[Never Let Me Go]] 
- Coining a new tag based on a joke term I use, #gui-futurism. Fantastical new ways we might write software to be interacted with, similar to #brain-apis which also make an appearance in this story. 
- Features the protection of a mischievous or non-productive person in the same way Khedron is used in [[The City and the Stars]] which I like as a concept
