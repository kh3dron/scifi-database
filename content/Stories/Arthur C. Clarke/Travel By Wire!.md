#comedy 

- A Scientist recounts the story of his invention.
- Lighthearted. Funny to think that this was his first ever story. Not many real stakes, just fun.
- This story I listened to as the first track on The Collected Works on Audible, on the first day working in the Laurel offices with Roshan. Good times.
