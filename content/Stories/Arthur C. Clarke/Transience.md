- Written by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]
- Generations of children play on a beach as the world changes around them.
- The child not knowing whatâ€™s happening while his parents take him away - reflected nicely by the reader not seeing everything in the story, only fragments. Much more somber and heartfelt than other early Clarkes - maybe something he builds up to over his career.
