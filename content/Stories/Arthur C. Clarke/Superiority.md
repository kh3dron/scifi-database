- Written by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]
- A general recounts how a war was lost due to the technical inferiority of the enemy.
- One of the rare stories that sticks with me for years, since I first read it in the lofted bed of my freshman dorm. It’s a perfect example of telling a story from a perspective that enhances it’s own worldbuilding, like [[Ted Chiang]] is great at. Has a great lesson - keep it simple, stupid.
