- Two children's paths diverge with the help of AI companions. 

- This is my favorite in the collection so far by far - it's the most speculative and explorative of the lot
- Like others in the collection, the conclusion feels a little heavy handed. I understand it might need to be that way when you're writing stories with such an agenda in mind, but I think it undermines the elegance and subtlety that really great fiction should use to make the same point. 
- Not quite #children/post-humans , but reminds me of [[Accelerando]] for a similar reason of kids becoming incomprehensible to their parent generations
