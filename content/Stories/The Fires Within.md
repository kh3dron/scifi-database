- Creatures of high density live deep inside the earth.
- Really like the dialogue between two creatures. Story is told from the perspective of them breaking to the surface and reading human wreckage - I like the framing that for them, it is equally unlikely to live in such low density as it is for us to live in the core of the earth.
- Similar to [[Castaway]]
