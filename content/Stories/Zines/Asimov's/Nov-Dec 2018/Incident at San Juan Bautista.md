- Rare to see stories set in the past
- Misdirection at first at the sort of story this is going to be - I wondered if there wouldn't be an SF twist in this until halfway through. Often means the result will be worse when that's the case, but this did not disappoint
- [[Transcendence]] sort of feel to the mass hive mind effect, especially with temporarily taking over the bodies. 
- Aliens outside of time very similar to [[Arrival]]
- Coining a new tag #time/time-trap
